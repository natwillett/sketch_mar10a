# Sketch Lab 7
 Natalie Willett
In this lab, we were introduced to Git and GitHub Desktop as tools for managing and tracking code changes, with a focus on understanding version control through commits, branches, and integration with Arduino projects. Git is a local version control system that allows users to track changes, revert to previous versions, create branches, and collaborate on code. GitHub, a cloud-based platform, hosts Git repositories and supports sharing, collaboration, and features pull requests for code review. Github desktop is a user-friendly GUI for performing Git and Github operations without using command-line tools, making is very accessible for beginners. In summary, Git is essential for tracking code changes, GitHub facilitates collaboration and code sharing, and GitHub Desktop simplifies the process through an intuitive interface. Overall, this lab helped me understand how version control streamlines workflow and improves project organization.
